# Invariant Parking Sequences

This is a repository with the programs that were used by the Parking Sequence research group in the Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics REU program.</br>

The 3D Inv. Parking Sequence Families file is a program that calculates all permutation invariant parking sequences up-to permutation given an arbitraty but fixed car length vector. This program helped us establish the families/forms for 2-tuple and 3-tuple car length vectors.</br>
